# machine-learning
This repository contains my daily implementations of machine learning algorithms.  
Each folder or file showcases a hands-on example where I apply the algorithm on real or synthetic datasets, with clear code, comments, and visualizations.

`LinearRegression/` → Simple linear regression on synthetic data
`LogisticRegression/` → Logistic regression on student performance dataset
